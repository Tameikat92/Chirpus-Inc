Homework assignment to rebuild site https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XxlsYLMeAbq1rbx__AsXI4giO7QyYxkbeBy1bsMR1o0/preview

In this project from Grand Circus bootcamp I had to style buttons with the correct color and style.

In my project I called the button class in along with each of my buttons. Check css guide for better understanding.

I also learned more about positioning items in this project. I used a display: flex; for positioning my link text

I also used conjoining classes more in this project. Thats when you build a class for two separate tags in one. An example is 
the " .info p " class for the information and the paragraph tags. THis may be worded incoreectly .
